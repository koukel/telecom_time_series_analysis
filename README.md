# Time Series Analysis of Telecommunications Revenue

## Project Overview

This project is based on a project from my graduate program and altered in order to add to my public portfolio.  This serves as an early example of my abilities as a reference to see how I have grown as a data scientist.  The data used in this dataset is available in this repository. 

In this project I have perfomed a time series analysis to predict future revenue.
